        Designer Twist was founded on February 5, 2024 in the Netherlands and consists of a group of 6 people, 3 Software Developers named Luuk Meulenbelt, Jay Schuurmans and Deniz Ã¼nal, and 3 Media Designers named Colin van den Berge, Dayna van Haasen, and Jasmijn Mooij. We created a game together called Turbo Twist, the aim of the game is to guide the penguin through a maze to the end and then win. We also made Merch and some posters and stickers.
